# ðŸ“‹ General Service Layer Guidelines

This document establishes the **universal** rules and patterns for creating all services in the project. A "service" is a module responsible for pure communication with an external system.

### 1. Core Principles

-   **Abstraction & Single Responsibility**: Each service must encapsulate the communication logic for a single domain or feature.
-   **React Independence**: Services **must not** import the `react` library or use any hooks. They are pure TypeScript modules.
-   **English Only**: All code, including comments and documentation, must be written in English.

### 2. Structure and Naming

-   **Main Directory**: All services must reside in `services/`.
-   **Subdirectories by Technology**: It is **mandatory** to create a subdirectory for each technology (e.g., `api/`, `firebase/`).
-   **File Naming**: Use the `.service.ts` suffix (e.g., `storage.service.ts`).
-   **Centralized Configuration**: SDK initialization (Firebase, Apollo Client) must be done in a central configuration file within its respective directory (e.g., `firebase/config.ts`, `api/client.ts`).
-   **Models**: All services must use the models in the `@/models` directory.

### 3. Global Implementation Rules

-   **Strict Typing**: All functions, parameters, and return values must be strictly typed. Use `Promise<ReturnType>` for asynchronous functions.
-   **Error Handling**:
    -   All external communication must be wrapped in a `try...catch` block.
    -   The service should catch the raw error, log it (`console.error`), and then **throw a new `Error`** with a standardized, user-friendly message.
